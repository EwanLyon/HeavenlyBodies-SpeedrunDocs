# Welcome

This is the speedrun docs page for Heavenly Bodies! This is very much in development from the guides to the website itself!

:::caution
This is all very in development! The way the website is structured, the way guides are written and everything else can and will be in flux and that's ok! Please let me know ideas, issues and bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/EwanLyon/HeavenlyBodies-SpeedrunDocs/issues) **(preffered!)** or message me on Discord (@clubwho).

## Rules

### General Game Rules

- Speedrun timer must be enabled.
  - Set to "Game" for full game runs.
  - Set to "Level" when doing IL runs.
- RTA Timing
  - Starts after the first cutscene has been skipped.
  - Stops when the Heavenly Bodies logo appears before the credits.
 
- Glitches that allow you to progress the game while the in game Speedrun timer is paused is not allowed.

### Cleanup DLC

- RTA Timing
  - Starts after the first cutscene has been skipped.
  - Stops when the detonator button is pressed.

### 100%

For 100% all things in the Operations Manual to be checked off. This does require proof at the end of the run that all items are checked off.

#### 1. Sunlight

- Collectable (Moonboot)
- Open the airlock door with the tennis racket

#### 2. Data

- Collectable (Project Mercury Capsule)
- Complete in under 10 minutes
- Play in Newtonian

#### 3. Vision

- Collectable (Sputnik)
- Assembly and deploy the Telescope without using the crane arms

:::note
Repairing the crane arms will *not* tick off assembling the telescope without arms. To complete this, make the telescope without using the arms. Once the telescope has been deployed you can repair the arms.
